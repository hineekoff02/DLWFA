To use:
1) Have prcemodel.py and prcetrain.py in the same directory.
2) Modify the CONFIG part in prcetrain.py with the desired parameters and file paths.
   Note: Epoch number needs to be 1 more than what you actually need.
3) Run. (Note that it is designed for use in a GPU cluster i.e. uses bash file paths)
